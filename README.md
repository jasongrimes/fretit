# Fret It: interactive, playable, editable fretboard diagrams.

Fret It is a colleciton of web applications for learning fretted instruments like guitar.
It provides *interactive* diagrams which change *in place* and produce *sound* at the same time.
This makes it much easier to learn certain concepts that are hard to convey any other way.

Showing how the diagrams change in place on the fretboard makes it easier to see how they relate to each other as you move from one to the next,
which is harder to do with traditional, separate diagrams.

Adding the dimension of sound to the visual diagrams,
and making them playable so you can experiment and tie them to your personal experience,
activates multimodal memory techniques 
which increase learning speed and retention according to a variety of studies.

Also, it's pretty fun. Try it at [fretit.io](https://fretit.io).

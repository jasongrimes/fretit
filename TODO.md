# Soon

- [ ] SEO-friendly URLs/routing
  - Tanstack router?
  - /about (shows about dialog)
  - /settings (shows settings dialog)
  - /{key}/{position}/{chord} ex. /c-major-key/II-position/I-chord-c-major
  - /guitar-positions/ baseurl, redirect there from / for now.

- [ ] Save settings in query parameters


# Next

- [ ] Make a fretit.io homepage. Use the description from the README

- [ ] Hide position selector dropdown when clicking outside.

# Later

- [ ] Fix intermittent sound failure on iOS https://github.com/jasongrimes/fretit/issues/2



# Maybe?

- [ ] Host the soundfont locally instead of using the built-in CDN.

- [ ] When changing key, consider defaulting to the current position by CAGED shape rather than positionIndex.
  (Experiment to see which is the more useful default.)

- [-] Label minor CAGED positions as minor (ex. Cm shape instead of C shape)?
- [ ] Generate images for each key/position/chord, use in SEO-friendly structured data for google images, social sharing, etc.
- [ ] One-click way to switch to relative minor in keychange settings.
- [ ] Add setting to control scroll/strum behavior. Swipe/drag to: (\*) strum ( ) scroll
- [ ] Seventh chords
- [ ] String styling (different widths, brass/wound bass strings)
- [ ] Automated product tour
  - Add "Product tour" to the "fretboard is playable" section in the about screen.
  - Add "play all" to position selector. Two options: scale, ascending fourths
  - Show how to practice chord melody?
    - Add scale degrees to the fretboard
    - Play through a simple "fly me to the moon" chord melody, or something similar
- [ ] Ukulele
